# Odin's Etch-a-Sketch

## Objective
Create a web application with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript to generate the divs. The grid should be displayed in a container div and arranged within. The application should also have a hover effect that changes the color of the divs when the mouse passes over them. Additionally, the application should include a button at the top of the screen that allows the user to enter the number of squares per side for a new grid. The existing grid should be replaced with a new grid of the same total size. Extra credit can be earned by having each pass through with the mouse change the color of the square to a completely random RGB value, and then adding 10% black to the color with each pass until the square is completely black after 10 passes.
